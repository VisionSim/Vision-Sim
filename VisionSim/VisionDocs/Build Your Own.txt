Building your own from source
=============================

Prerequisites

Mono V3.x    : Checkout http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html for the latest update

Building
========

Clone the Vision repo at https://github.com/VisionSim/Vision-Dev.git


Cd the the downloaded directory.
Run(Execute) the  ./runprebuild.sh file to create the required c# solution files.

Compile Vision :
#:  xbuild Vision.sln

A large amount of compile information will be shown but when completed, 
no errors should be indicated.
NOTE:  Some warnings may be shown (36 at last count) but these do not present 
any problem or prevent operation of the servers. 
(These will be corrected and removed as time permits)

When completed the 'VisionSim/bin' subdirectory will contain the newly compiled Vision files.

Copy the 'bin' subdirectory to your existing Vision installation, replacing the 'bin' directory there.

Restart as per normal using the appropriate script file.
Answer 'No' if asked to re-configure at startup.

Checkout the ReadMe.txt file for the rest
